# **What I Hope to Learn in Info 201**

I want to learn how to make great data visualizations for websites and apps. As an English major, I want to *improve my coding skills* and *branch into tech*. I hope that this class will help me get started learning useful tools for my career and that I will get to meet some cool people! Some things that I'm particularly interested in learning during this class:

- **markdown language**
- interactive charts
- command line interaction/git
- **web applications**
- group project management
